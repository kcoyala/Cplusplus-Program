# Cplusplus-Program
  This is project 3 from the course.  This code reads a file of grocery items and looks at how many times each item was purchased (in the file).  Then it allows a user to select 1 of 3 options. See how many times each item was in the file, see how many different items was in the file, and show a pictogram of each item and how many times it was in the file.

For this program I did a good job of keeping main as small as possible.  It only has 1 line where it calls the menu function and everything runs from there. 

I think I could do a better job with the whitespace and alignment which could help with readability. 

I was having a really hard time getting the pictogram portion done.  But after doing a lot of research and looking at examples of code, I was eventually able to get it done and funcioning properly.

The ability to get pythong and C++ together will be helpful in future.  Additionally the work with files and such was interesting and I am sure will be very very useful in the future

I think the code is maintainable since main is really small and each function is written independently so each option can be modified without messing with the others.  It is pretty easy to read, but I could work on the whitespace and the alignment. It is adaptable again because main is so small.  New options could be added to the menu easily and each function can be modified easily.
